## 📚 Lessons Learned
- How to build a multi-section template with navigation  
- Structuring content semantically with HTML  
- Organizing and styling multiple sections cohesively with CSS  
- Using counters, responsive images and layouts  
- Designing filterable portfolio sections  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add responsiveness (mobile / tablet) — currently design might not adapt perfectly  
- Integrate animations or transitions (hover effects, scroll animations)  
- Add JavaScript for dynamic behavior (filtering portfolio, smooth scroll, counters)  
- Add form validation or connect contact form with backend (e.g. via API)  
- Add optimization (minify CSS, compress images)
